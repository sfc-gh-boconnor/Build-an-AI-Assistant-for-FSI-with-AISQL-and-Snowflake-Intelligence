# Tables to Remove from Script 02 - Generated by Notebooks

## Summary
These tables are currently loaded in script 02 but can be generated by notebooks.
Removing them will significantly simplify the deployment.

## Tables Generated by Notebook 1 (Document AI)
- ✅ PARSED_ANALYST_REPORTS (already removed)
- ✅ AI_EXTRACT_ANALYST_REPORTS_ADVANCED (already removed)
- ✅ ANALYST_REPORTS_ALL_DATA (already removed)
- ❌ **FINANCIAL_REPORTS** - Uses AI_EXTRACT on financial report PDFs
- ❌ **INFOGRAPHIC_METRICS_EXTRACTED** - Uses AI_EXTRACT on infographic PNGs
- ❌ **EMAIL_PREVIEWS_EXTRACTED** - Uses AI_EXTRACT + AI_SENTIMENT on emails

## Tables Generated by Notebook 2 (Audio Analysis)
- ❌ **TRANSCRIBED_EARNINGS_CALLS** - Uses AI_TRANSCRIBE on MP3 files
- ❌ **SPEAKER_MAPPING** - Extracts speaker names from transcripts
- ❌ **TRANSCRIBED_EARNINGS_CALLS_WITH_SENTIMENT** - Adds AI_SENTIMENT to transcripts
- ❌ **AI_TRANSCRIBE_NO_TIME** - Transcript without timestamps
- ❌ **SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS** - AI_SENTIMENT analysis of transcripts
- ❌ **TRANSCRIPTS_BY_MINUTE** - Time-segmented transcripts

## Tables Generated by Notebook 4 (Search Services)
- ❌ **INFOGRAPHICS_FOR_SEARCH** - Adds presigned URLs for search
- ❌ **FULL_TRANSCRIPTS** - Adds presigned URLs to call_embeds

## Recommendation
**Remove all ❌ tables from script 02**

Keep only:
- Raw CSV data loads (email_previews, stock_prices, etc.)
- Base stages for documents
- Essential reference data

This will:
1. Simplify deployment (fewer data loads, fewer parsing issues)
2. Make notebooks more valuable (students see AI in action)
3. Reduce script 02 from ~1800 lines to ~800 lines
4. Eliminate all problematic AI-generated data loads

## Decision
Remove these 11 tables + data loads from script 02
